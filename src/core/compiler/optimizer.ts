 * Goal of the optimizer: walk the generated template AST tree
 * and detect sub-trees that are purely static, i.e. parts of
 * the DOM that never needs to change.
 *
 * Once we detect these sub-trees, we can:
 *
 * 1. Hoist them into constants, so that we no longer need to
 *    create fresh nodes for them on each re-render;
 * 2. Completely skip them in the patching process.
